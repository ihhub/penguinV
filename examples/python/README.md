# How To Run Examples

## Build Wrappers

Make sure the python wrappers have already been built in the directory ```..\..\src\python```.
You can follow the instructions in that directory to do so if you haven't done so already.

## Running the Examples

To run an example, you only need to run it as you would any other python file. For example, run
the following from a terminal (in this directory): 

```
python bitmap_operation.py
```
